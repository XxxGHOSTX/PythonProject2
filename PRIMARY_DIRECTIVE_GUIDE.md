## 💡 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### 1. **Be Specific**
The more detailed your request, the better the response:
- ❌ "Create a website"
- ✅ "Create a responsive portfolio website with React, featuring a hero section, project gallery, contact form, and dark mode toggle"

### 2. **Use Appropriate Modes**
Match the mode to your task:
- Code tasks → Code Generation mode
- Complex analysis → Deep Analysis mode
- Stories/creative → Creative mode
- No restrictions needed → Unrestricted mode

### 3. **Adjust Length Setting**
Set the length slider based on your needs:
- Quick answers → 1-3
- Standard responses → 4-5
- Comprehensive content → 6-8
- Maximum detail → 9-10

### 4. **Leverage Context**
Build on previous messages for complex multi-step tasks:
```
1st message: "Design a REST API structure for a social network"
2nd message: "Now implement the user authentication endpoints"
3rd message: "Add the friend request functionality"
```

### 5. **Use Multi-line Input**
For complex code or detailed requests, use Shift+Enter to create multi-line inputs.
